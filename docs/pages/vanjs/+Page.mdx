## `create-vanjs`

We recommend using [create-vanjs](https://github.com/thednp/create-vanjs) which integrates VanJS with a set of starter templates using Vike.

```bash
npm create vanjs@latest
```
Follow the prompts and select one of the Vike starter templates:

 - `vike` - a fully featured starter template;
 - `vike-jsx` - a fully featured starter template with JSX.

You can also <Link href="#custom-integration">integrate VanJS yourself</Link>.


## Custom integration

Currently there is no dedicated Vike extension for VanJS, but it's easy to integrate VanJS on your own, for full control over the integration of VanJS and VanJS libraries.


Community examples:
 - [`vike-ts` source code](https://github.com/thednp/create-vanjs/tree/master/template-vike-ts) - Full-featured Typescript integration.
 - [`vike` source code](https://github.com/thednp/create-vanjs/tree/master/template-vike) - Full-featured integration.
 - [`vike-jsx-ts` source code](https://github.com/thednp/create-vanjs/tree/master/template-vike-jsx-ts) - Full-featured JSX Typescript integration.
 - [`vike-jsx` source code](https://github.com/thednp/create-vanjs/tree/master/template-vike-jsx) - Full-featured JSX integration.
